## Used techs:

    - Node.js;
    - Express 4;
    - Database in files (with Node FileSystem);
    - Json Web Token (Authentication routes);
    - Dotenv (create environment variable)

## How it works:

### The Routes:

##### The API uses some access routes so that the user has the best possible experience with the system. They contain the famous CRUD with a semi relational database that searches the data for the same verification id.
###### The routes are:
    
    - /games
    - /moves

    These routes are responsible for creating a game and obtaining some information about this or another game, in the case of "/games". On the other hand, "/moves" is responsible for sending the movements and checking if they are in accordance with the rules (English checkers). according to the rules, the move takes place.
